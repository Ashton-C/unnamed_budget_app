## Unnamed Budget App

This app was made because I got sick of looking for a proper budgeting app that ticked _ALL_ of my boxes(mulitple users, bank account connection, etc).

### Important Pieces

The app uses a couple key pieces of tech. It's built with:

- Node (with express)
- React
- Twilio
- MongoDB

### WARNING

This app is highly customized for my uses, it is only on Github for sake of building a portfolio. In order to link with my bank account, I've taken advantage of a feature from my bank that sends a text message to a phone number(the Twilio number) every time a charge goes through my account. I haven't figured out deployment yet, but it will probably be something personal for just me and my wife. Feel free to clone and set up your own Twilio and bank account stuff at your own risk.
